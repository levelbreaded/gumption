# Naming things

Naming things is hard, so we loosely document decisions in naming while we go.
This might go poorly.

### Branch or branch name?

Branches mean lots of things, for clarity, anything that is a string of a branch
name will be called a "branchName" and a branch implies an object containing
more data than that (the repo is not currently like this but will be rewritten
to adhere to it).

### Put some respect on the name

Capitalize Gumption in comments so it's obvious we mean Gumption, the project,
and not whimsically using the word gumption for delight.
